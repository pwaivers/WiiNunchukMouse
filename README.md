# Wii Nunchuk Mouse README

## What is this project

This is Python code to allow the Wii Nunchuk ([Yes it's spelled without the second 'c'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote#Nunchuk)) to used as a mouse on Apple OS X.
It utilizes the Arduino to talk with the Wii Nunchuk and the Python script reads the serial output of the Arduino.

## Who is this written for

This is primarily that DIY beginner like me, who has an Arduino and not sure what to do with it.  
I had a Wii sitting around and ordered the nunchuk adapter. 
I then found a few examples online of the nunchuk being used as a mouse, but they were for a Windows OS, like [here](http://makezine.com/projects/make-33/wii-nunchuk-mouse/).
